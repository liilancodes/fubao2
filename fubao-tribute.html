            <p id="tribute-info">Fu Bao is the first giant panda born in South Korea. She was born on July 20, 2020, at Everland Resort, a theme park in Yongin, near Seoul. Fu Bao's birth was a significant milestone, as giant pandas are an endangered species and breeding them in captivity can be challenging. Her parents, Ai Bao (mother) and Le Bao (father), were loaned to South Korea by China in 2016 as part of a panda diplomacy program. Fu Bao quickly became a beloved figure in South Korea, drawing many visitors to Everland to see her grow and thrive.</p>
